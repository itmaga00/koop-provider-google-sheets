# Google Sheets Provider
Create a provider to consume data from Google Sheets inside Insights for ArcGIS

## Overview

This project is a Koop provider. It uses Javascript to create an express web server with web service that knows how to communicate with Google Sheets.  
While under review, the web service is compatiable with Insights for ArcGIS and other ArcGIS products. 


## Dependencies

* NodeJS

## Instructions

``` git clone https://github.com/ArcGIS/google-sheets-provider.git ```
``` cd google-sheets-provider ```
``` npm install ```
``` npm start ```


e.g. Once you've run ``` npm start ``` you should see something like this:
[https://googlesheets-provider-hkrquwqwvp.now.sh/googlesheets/FeatureServer/0](https://googlesheets-provider-hkrquwqwvp.now.sh/googlesheets/FeatureServer/0)
